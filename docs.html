		<p>Apart from your baggage (clothes, footwear etc.), we expect you to bring the following items
		with you:</p>
		<p>1. Sport shoes (First Years are expected to attend Morning PT)</p>
		<p>2. Scientific calculator</p>
		<p>Other items of daily usage shall be available on campus at competitive prices (can be brought
		from home too):</p>
		<p>1. Bed Roll â€“ 3x6 ft</p>
		<p>2. Pillows</p>
		<p>3. Sanitary Items - Buckets, Mugs, Soaps etc.</p>
		<p>4. Dustbins</p>
		<p>5. Cloth Hangers</p>
		<p>Things that shall be available outside the campus:-</p>
		<p>1. Curtains</p>
		<p>2. Cellphone Connections</p>
		<em>Cellphone Connections</em>
		<p>Mobile connections can be availed from Indira Nagar, barely 1 km from IIIT-H campus. One can
		get connections from many cellphone network service providers, like Vodafone, Airtel, etc.
		P.S. If you could bring some documents from home itself for getting your accounts opened it
		would be easier since it could take the college authorities some time to provide you with the
		necessary documents for the same.</p>
		<em>Bank Accounts</em>
		<p>There is a branch of State Bank of Hyderabad within the campus. It would be at the discretion of
		your parents/local guardians to open a bank account here. Again, it would be easier if you could
		bring some documents along with its photocopies and photographs from your home itself for
		getting your accounts opened since it could take some time for the college authorities to provide
		you with the necessary documents for the same.<br>
		Additionally, there is a SBH and a HDFC bank ATM present on campus.</p>
		<em>Healthcare</em>
		<p>There is no pharmacy inside the campus. An outlet of Apollo Pharmacy is situated less than a km
		away from the campus but students are advised to bring whichever necessary medicines as per
		their individual needs. First aid kits are present with hostel guards, and an ambulance is available on call.
		A clinic is operational during daytime called Aarogya centre where doctors can be consulted.
		A discount is provided at nearby hospitals for IIIT students.</p>
