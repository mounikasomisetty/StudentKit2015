<p>Most of you,like me, would be coming here after spending two years, if not more, of vigorous training. After all that , frankly I had no great  expectations about college life. Least did I know, that I was going to have the four most wonderful years of my life. Each year was a roller coaster ride with its own share of fun and challenges.Let me tell you about some things which are unique to IIIT and things you can look forward to in your coming 4 years.</p>

<p> Initially, everything will seem so different ,the work culture, assignments , labs, projects and the most challenging of them all ,OJ and PT. All this will not be a piece of cake . This is when you need to come out of your comfort zone and try to interact with as many people as possible. Seniors play a very important role in IIIT. Right from guiding you through your courses, to helping you with your assignments , encouraging you to participate in various activities and being your constant source of advice.The junior senior bonding is one of the most beautiful relationships I have come across in IIIT.</p>

<p>Another important aspect of college life is the campus life or the co-curricular activities. We may not have the best of the resources here, for sports or for  other activities, but you will always find opportunities to showcase your talents at every point. Above all, the encouragement you get from your seniors and faculty to participate in various activities is unmatchable .Never let go of any of these opportunities as they will help you develop an all round personality, which is very important in today's world.</p>

<p>IIIT has molded me into a confident and independent person and has taught me the fine art of balancing work and play.I can proudly say that joining IIIT was  the best choice I have made till date and I hope it will be the same for you as well. Make the most of the coming four years as these moments will live on forever.CHEERS !</p>

<p>IIIT acted as a great weapon for me to think beyond Innovation and Technology.</p>

<p>First, my experience in IIIT has given me a chance to sharpen my skills in my field of choice. There have been, and there will continue to be, many opportunities to learn more ways to improve my craft, which I am truly thankful for.</p>

<p>The eco system in IIIT not only puts our limits across our visions but also with the greatest combination of minds across india being at one place, we learn a lot about society and life values!
Books, Classes, Fun, Games, Friends etc running around us within the campus enriches our ability to achieve our goals.
I began to work my own startup in 2nd year and the ecosystem at IIIT has accelerated me to the next level of my thoughts. Perseverance that matters most to any individual, Exploring the opportunities with the resources in IIIT will give an amazing future ahead!</p>1

<p>When I walked into this college, I was a bundle of emotions. Scared, confused and excited, all at the same time. Soon, I met my batchmates, seniors, and it has been a rollercoaster ride ever since.</p>

<p>After getting over the initial shock of how different college is from school, ( or our coaching days ;) ), it amazed me to see the diverse and awesome set of people I found here. Coders, dancers, developers, musicians, bookworms, athletes, just about everybody has something great to offer.</p>

<p>The curriculum of CLD is pretty similar to CSE barring a few courses. It gives a perfect blend of computer sciences and working with language technologies. Working with the intricacies of Indian languages and dealing with them computationally is an upcoming field which fascinates me. While the workload may be heavier than you might expect, you’ll find yourself being surprised at every little detail you notice in a language you thought you knew for your whole life!</p>

<p>College is the time when we come out of our shells and try out all the activities and hobbies we had left behind. IIIT gives us an ample amount of opportunities to participate in cultural events throughout the year. Even better, we are encouraged to start something of our own ,may it be a club or an event, if we are truly interested. Be it inter house competitions, helping out with the college fest, hackathons, there is something for everyone!</p>

<p>Going to college is as much about finding out who you really are as it is about getting that degree.<hr>

<p>I joined IIIT in 2012 as an aspiring young student who was about to embark upon a new journey. I came in through DASA and had come with a skeptical mind shaped by the experiences of a family friend who had joined one of the NIT's through DASA. I was told about the general dislike towards the DASA crowd which was a problem few years ago in the NIT's. The professors, the other students etc. would all look down upon the DASA students and not expect them to be bright. Even the recruiters from companies had a stereotypical mind and would often quote the phrase "Oh! You're DASA" when a student wouldn't perform well in an interview. On coming to IIIT, I was also expecting such reactions from people. To my surprise, I was treated like any other student. No judging/stereotyping/discrimination took place because I was from a foreign land. On my first day here, when we had our orientation meeting, I went and interacted with a couple of people and managed to make a few new friends. We had our campus tour and then a bunch of us came back to have some juice. It was easy to make new friends and no one showed any sort of derogatory attitude towards me or even the other people who had come through DASA. That night, I went and sat in my neighbour's room and we kept on chatting for quite a while and I had made my first close friend in IIIT.</p>

<p>As the days went by, I met a lot of new people among my own batch mates and the seniors. After meeting such people, I was glad that I chose IIIT over other colleges and I was sure that I wouldn't be able to get such an experience in other colleges. The amount of exposure that I have gotten has helped me better myself in ways that I could not have imagined. One can learn something that can change their lives in small small ways for the better from almost each new person that they meet. Also, the sort of opportunities one can get in this college is something that cannot be found elsewhere. This place has taught me lot of things that will be important later on in life and has let me do things I thought I would never be able to do.</p>

<p>These 4 years (more than 4 for dual degree students) of our lives are what shape how we are for the coming years. It's up to us how we utilize our time here and get the best out of these years, these friends, these people that we have and meet. I try and make sure not to regret my time over here. Don't run behind what everyone else is doing especially if you aren't interested in them. IIIT Gives you a bucket load of opportunities that you can make so much out of if you learn to step outside your comfort zone. This is probably the most important lesson that I have learnt at IIIT, getting comfortable outside your comfort zone. I wish all the incoming freshers the best of luck for what will change your life forever.</p>

<p>Hello folks! You’ve come to start a new journey! Guess what- You’ll probably love IIIT!
To give you a peek into what waits ahead - You are free from the shackles of Physics, Chemistry and Biology. Dive into Comp. Sci.! Follow your passions! </p>

<p>I was really passionate about research when I joined in. In IIIT, we get a lot of freedom.
Yes! Explore your passions. I used to sit in random interesting lectures whenever I wanted to!
I got to learn, I got to explore the R&D Labs! I could do what I’ve been waiting for, finally! </p>

<p>The first year for me was exciting and a bit frightening. Frightened of the consequences of living one heck of a life. By not being told what should I study anymore - I was, and you are free to explore Linguistics, Economics, Electronics and much more! </p>

<p>The consequences of following your passions are indeed breath-taking!
Awesome friends, amazing time and even a few research paper in an international conference!
Want to try out Entrepreneurship? Go ahead!
Coding? Go ahead!
Web Development? Go ahead!
Opportunities are limitless, my friend!</p>


<p>Also, remember in your pursuit, the sayings of the wise- “With great freedom comes great responsibility”. The institute offers you some core courses that you ought to know well.
Tip: Master them! They’re essential in the long run. Do your assignments!
No, not on paper! Welcome to the evil OJ! You’ll know what that is, soon enough. :D </p>

<p>Make friends with your batchmates and seniors. They’re going to be some of your best buddies for the next few years, at least. Being a small but closely-knit community, everyone knows everyone - Juniors and seniors alike. They’ll help you in your moving past your hurdles, they’ll celebrate with you in your success!</p>

<p>Now is the time, my friends! Shed all the past fears, break from the shackl</p>

<p>After my JEE(mains as well as advanced) I was waiting for a seat in counselling process, with the aggregate I got in 12th it seemed difficult to get seat in a good NIT. Then I was searching for the colleges which consider only the score of JEE-Mains and nothing else. Then, it all started. At first, I was shocked, because I didn’t even knew that there exists a IIIT in Hyderabad and then I applied for it and got a seat in BSD. I was again afraid thinking what will be my future? Coz, the branch in which I’m gonna join is not any regular branch. It’s a new curriculum started by IIIT for the first time in India and also my batch is the second one to join under this course. So, there were no pass-outs to clarify my doubts regarding my future! But, what else I can do when I’ve got no seat elsewhere. So, I’ve joined this college.</p>

<p>At first, I never used to talk with others. Throughout my 1st year my life was like “Me, My Room & My Laptop”. But once when I’ve stepped out of my room(at the end of my 1st year), I’ve seen a different world with wonderful friends, and many amazing experiences. So, what I suggest is ‘make friends, enjoy your stay, participate in all the events that happen’. The cult events here are awesome. Felicity is the main event in an academic year. Those three nights are the fun nights. And the batch trips are the ones where you’ll re-discover yourself. You have all the wonderful experiences waiting out here for you. </p>

<p>And an important thing is this college changes you from a KID to an ADULT. You’ll know your responsibilities, you’ll know what is life, you’ll have different experiences, the knowledge of which will be helpful maybe in your future! And remember, academics aren’t everything. Getting good grades and marks may fetch you a nice job but can’t fetch you the valuable experiences you get by being with your friends. </p>

		<p>Welcome to IIIT!</p>

<p>Amidst difficult times of counselling, I chose IIIT Hyderabad because of its emphasis on research. Not only has IIIT offered me opportunities that I had never thought of, but also it has moulded me into a responsible and confident person that I am now.</p>

<p>First few months were like an adventure, where you make a ton of friends with your batchmates and seniors, try new and different things you never dreamt of, follow your instincts, find your passions and make your own everlasting memories. From infinite assignments to never ending exams, from sleeping during lectures to working all night for Felicity, IIIT has taught me to learn from everything. It has taught me that I can pursue whatever I believe in, if I  try hard enough. It has taught me that Google has solution to every problem. :P </p>

<p>Been a part Social Media Team, Alumni Cell and Felicity, I have learnt that college offers ample opportunities to participate in extracurricular activities as well as those which help one build his/her personality. These past two years have been filled with many ups and downs but the most important thing one learn at IIIT is to “Never give up”. </p>

<p>We all have with us our set of dreams and this is the time to break free your cages and chase your dreams. I wish you happy 4/5 years(or more ;) ) of your life at IIIT and I hope you and me will make next Felicity, the best ever!
Welcome to the family.</p>
